# 🎬 Netflix & HBO Max: Content Synergy Analysis

### 📊 Project Overview
In the competitive streaming landscape, content retention is key. This project analyzes the libraries of **Netflix** and **HBO Max (Warner Bros)** to evaluate the strategic value of a potential merger or partnership.

**The Business Question:** How would acquiring Warner Bros' catalog address Netflix's current content gaps?

### 🔍 Key Insights
1.  **The Vintage Gap:** Netflix's library is heavily skewed towards post-2015 content ("Recency Bias"). HBO Max possesses a strong back-catalog from 1980–2010, which is crucial for retaining subscribers between new releases.
2.  **The Genre Gap:** While Netflix dominates in International and Drama categories, it lacks depth in "Sci-Fi/Fantasy" and "Classics"—two pillars of the Warner Bros library.
3.  **Strategic Verdict:** The libraries are highly complementary. A merger would fill Netflix's "Classic Content" hole immediately.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Data cleaning and manipulation (Pandas).
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib & Seaborn.
* **Data Processing:** Handling missing values, string manipulation, and merging datasets.
